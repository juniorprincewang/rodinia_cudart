CUDA Runtime benchmark.  

# Download dataset

Please download the dataset contained in
[Rodinia 3.1](http://lava.cs.virginia.edu/Rodinia/download_links.htm).


Copy the data directory into rodinia.  

# Environment variables

Set the environment variables in scripts/environments, including dataset path,
AvA modes, etc.

The library paths in `opencl/util/make.mk` and `cuda/util/nvidia.mk` need to
set appropriately.

# Run benchmarks

In `scripts/`, `test_cl.sh` is used to run all OpenCL benchmarks and
`test_cu.sh` is for CUDA benchmarks. `parse.sh` is used to compute the
average end-to-end execution time.

Only `test_cudart.sh` is supoorted in this repository.  

# Run individual benchmarks

Every benchmark has a `run` bash script in their corresponding directory.
Simply execute the script to run the benchmark.
