This benchmark suite is based on Rodinia 2.0.1, which was originally 
developed by the researchers from the Laboratiry for Computer Architecture
at Virginia (LAVA).
The original Rodinia project is found at:
https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~skadron/wiki/rodinia/index.php

Our Gdev project has modified the CUDA programs in the Rodinia benchmark to
use the CUDA Driver API instead of the CUDA Runtime API. 
We redistribute our modified Rodinia benchmark under the original Rodinia 
license (http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~sc5nf/license.htm).
If you find that our redistribution of source code violates any of the
original Rodinia license terms, please let us know.
